## 🧠 AI Tools Used

> Note: AI usage was limited to ~20% of the code.  
> Majority of the work, including data integration, component logic, performance optimizations, and theme styling, was hand-written.

### AI Usage
- Minor UI Suggestions: AI helped with black–gold gradient CSS patterns and tooltip styling.
- Chart Configuration Templates: Basic chart scaffolds (PieChart, LineChart) were generated by AI and later rewritten for theme consistency.
- Initial Search Hook: A debounce hook was generated, but later removed in favor of real-time search.

## 📌 Hand-Written Code 
 
API integration with `/api/portfolio/*` 
Holdings filtering and modal handling 
Performance vs Benchmarks chart logic (indexed to 100) 
Top Performers section logic & design 
Theme & CSS variables (black–gold) 
Company logo mapping (public folder) 
Page title logo integration 

---

## 🛠 How AI Helped

1. Chart Starter Code – Provided skeletons for Recharts which were later optimized.
2. CSS Gradient Samples – Suggested gradient directions and color stops for gold styling.
3. Minor Debugging Hints – Helped identify that `Area` chart type was obscuring portfolio trace.
